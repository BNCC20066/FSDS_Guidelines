Your task is to predict median house values in Californian districts, given a number of features from these districts.*\n","\n","## Look at the Big Picture\n","\n","Welcome to the Hacktiv8 Machine Learning Housing Corporation! Your first task is to use California census data to build a model of housing prices in the state. This data includes metrics such as the population, median income, and median housing price for each block group in California. Block groups are the smallest geographical unit for which the US Census Bureau publishes sample data (a block group typically has a population of 600 to 3,000 people). We will call them “districts” for short.\n","\n","Your model should learn from this data and be able to predict the median housing\n","price in any district, given all the other metrics.\n","\n","### Frame the Problem\n","\n","The first question to ask your boss is what exactly the business objective is. Building a model is probably not the end goal. How does the company expect to use and benefit from this model? Knowing the objective is important because it will determine how you frame the problem, which algorithms you will select, which performance measure you will use to evaluate your model, and how much effort you will spend tweaking it.\n","\n","Your boss answers that your model’s output (a prediction of a district’s median housing price) will be fed to another Machine Learning system, along with many other signals.3 This downstream system will determine whether it is worth investing in a given area or not. Getting this right is critical, as it directly affects revenue.\n","\n","The next question to ask your boss is what the current solution looks like (if any). The current situation will often give you a reference for performance, as well as insights on how to solve the problem. Your boss answers that the district housing prices are currently estimated manually by experts: a team gathers up-to-date information about a district, and when they cannot get the median housing price, they estimate it using complex rules.\n","\n","This is costly and time-consuming, and their estimates are not great; in cases where they manage to find out the actual median housing price, they often realize that their estimates were off by more than 20%. This is why the company thinks that it would be useful to train a model to predict a district’s median housing price, given other data about that district. The census data looks like a great dataset to exploit for this purpose, since it includes the median housing prices of thousands of districts, as well as other data.\n","\n","With all this information, you are now ready to start designing your system. First, you need to frame the problem: is it supervised, unsupervised, or Reinforcement Learning? Is it a classification task, a regression task, or something else? Should you use batch learning or online learning techniques? Before you read on, pause and try to answer these questions for yourself.\n","\n","Have you found the answers? Let’s see: it is clearly a typical supervised learning task, since you are given labeled training examples (each instance comes with the expected output, i.e., the district’s median housing price). It is also a typical regression task, since you are asked to predict a value. More specifically, this is a multiple regression problem, since the system will use multiple features to make a prediction (it will use the district’s population, the median income, etc.). It is also a univariate regression problem, since we are only trying to predict a single value for each district. If we were trying to predict multiple values per district, it would be a multivariate regression\n","problem. Finally, there is no continuous flow of data coming into the system, there is no particular need to adjust to changing data rapidly, and the data is small enough to fit in memory, so plain batch learning should do just fine.\n","\n","### Check the Assumptions\n","\n","Lastly, it is good practice to list and verify the assumptions that have been made so far (by you or others); this can help you catch serious issues early on. For example, the district prices that your system outputs are going to be fed into a downstream\n","Machine Learning system, and you assume that these prices are going to be used as such. But what if the downstream system converts the prices into categories (e.g., \"cheap,\" \"medium,\" or \"expensive\") and then uses those categories instead of the prices themselves? In this case, getting the price perfectly right is not important at all; your system just needs to get the category right. If that’s so, then the problem should have been framed as a classification task, not a regression task. You don’t want to find this out after working on a regression system for months.\n","\n","Fortunately, after talking with the team in charge of the downstream system, you are confident that they do indeed need the actual prices, not just categories. Great! You’re all set, the lights are green, and you can start coding now!\n","\n","\n","\n"],"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"EGsqKRncLI9c"},"source":["## Setup"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"r1ob2RinLI9c"},"source":["First, let's import a few common modules, ensure MatplotLib plots figures inline and prepare a function to save the figures.
