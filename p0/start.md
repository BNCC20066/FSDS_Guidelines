Welcome to Phase 0
=======================

Hello all **Hacktiv8's Pythoneer**! Welcome to Phase 0. Prepare yourself for your journey ahead becoming Data Scientist of the future.

In Phase 0 you are going to learn all about Python and basic data scientist need in order to fullfil phase 0's objectives, which is:

- Able to gain insight and make inference from data
- Able to build fully interactive dashboard for visualization

In the first week, you are going to learn Python, Numpy, Pandas, SQL, and Git. Outcome of this week of lecture are able to write basic syntax of Python, having knowledge about Python data types, control flow, looping, and function.

You also be able to prepare and clean your data using Pandas, perform query againts dataframe and using SQL. Last, you have knowledge and able to perform basic Git workflow.

Second week, you are going to go deep into Math such as Linear Algebra and Multivariate Calculus. Learn about what is Scalar, Vectors, Matrices, and Tensor. Having knowledge about Space Transformation, Derivatives, and Integrals.

After going deep with Math, in third week you are going to learn about Probability and Statistics. Learn about Basic Probability Theory, Probability Distribution Function, Descriptive Statistics and Inferential Statistics.

Last week in Phase 0 you are going to learn all about visualization. Start with basic visualization using Matplotlib such as Line, Histogram, Box, Scatter, etc, and advanced visualization such as Word Cloud and Maps.
You also going to learn other visualization library such as Seaborn and Plotly, and ends with building your own interactive dashboard using Dash.
