Released in 2017 as a Python library, it’s grown to include implementations for R and Julia. Dash helps data scientists build analytical web applications without requiring advanced web development knowledge.\n","\n","Three technologies constitute the core of Dash:\n","\n","1. Flask supplies the web server functionality.\n","2. React.js renders the user interface of the web page.\n","3. Plotly.js generates the charts used in your application.\n","\n","But you don’t have to worry about making all these technologies work together. Dash will do that for you. You just need to write Python, R, or Julia and sprinkle it with a bit of CSS.\n","\n","Plotly, a Canada-based company, built Dash and supports its development. You may know the company from the popular graphing libraries that share its name. Plotly (the company) open-sourced Dash and released it under an MIT license, so you can use Dash at no cost.\n","\n","Plotly also offers a commercial companion to Dash called Dash Enterprise. This paid service provides companies with support services such as hosting, deploying, and handling authentication on Dash applications. But these features live outside of Dash’s open source ecosystem.\n","\n","Dash will help you build dashboards quickly. If you’re used to analyzing data or building data visualizations using Python, then Dash will be a useful addition to your toolbox."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"tnyNMbXgsCuq"},"source":["## Installing Dash\n","\n","Installing Dash is fairly simple. We will only need one command to get it to run. Make sure if you haven’t recently, update your version of pip.\n","\n","`sudo pip3 install dash`\n","\n","For me, that was all I needed to install. In a tutorial, I found that you may also need to install the following:\n","\n","```sh\n","sudo pip3 install dash-html-components\n","sudo pip3 install dash-core-components\n","```\n","\n","The extra packages there should have installed during your first installation of Dash. When I ran the extra installs, I received “requirement met” messages back from the attempt. Still, it’s better safe than sorry to include those, just in case something didn’t install properly or if any versions were out of date."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"iFRRClEStB-T"},"source":["## Dash Layout\n","\n","Dash apps are composed of two parts.

The \"inputs\" and \"outputs\" of our application's interface are described declaratively as the arguments of the `@app.callback` decorator. Learn more about using the `@app.callback` decorator.\n","  - By writing this decorator, we're telling Dash to call this function for us whenever the value of the \"input\" component (the text box) changes in order to update the children of the \"output\" component on the page (the HTML div).\n","  - You can use any name for the function that is wrapped by the `@app.callback` decorator. The convention is that the name describes the callback output(s).\n","  - You can use any name for the function arguments, but you must use the same names inside the callback function as you do in its definition, just like in a regular Python function. The arguments are positional: first the `Input` items and then any `State` items are given in the same order as in the decorator.\n","  - You must use the same `id` you gave a Dash component in the `app.layout` when referring to it as either an input or output of the `@app.callback` decorator.\n","  - The `@app.callback` decorator needs to be directly above the callback function declaration. If there is a blank line between the decorator and the function definition, the callback registration will not be successful.\n","\n","2. In Dash, the inputs and outputs of our application are simply the properties of a particular component. In this example, our input is the `\"value\"` property of the component that has the ID `\"my-input\"`. Our output is the `\"children\"` property of the component with the ID `\"my-output\"`.\n","3. Whenever an input property changes, the function that the callback decorator wraps will get called automatically. Dash provides the function with the new value of the input property as an input argument and Dash updates the property of the output component with whatever was returned by the function.\n","4. The `component_id` and `component_property` keywords are optional (there are only two arguments for each of those objects). They are included in this example for clarity but will be omitted in the rest of the documentation for the sake of brevity and readability.\n","5. Don't confuse the `dash.dependencies.Input` object and the `dash_core_components.Input` object. The former is just used in these callbacks and the latter is an actual component.\n","6. Notice how we don't set a value for the `children` property of the `my-output` component in the `layout`. When the Dash app starts, it automatically calls all of the callbacks with the initial values of the input components in order to populate the initial state of the output components. In this example, if you specified something like `html.Div(id='my-output', children='Hello world')`, it would get overwritten when the app starts.\n","\n","It's sort of like programming with Microsoft Excel: whenever an input cell changes, all of the cells that depend on that cell will get updated automatically. This is called \"Reactive Programming\".\n","\n","Remember how every component was described entirely through its set of keyword arguments? Those properties are important now. With Dash interactivity, we can dynamically update any of those properties through a callback function. Frequently we'll update the `children` of a component to display new text or the `figure` of a `dcc.Graph` component to display new data, but we could also update the `style` of a component or even the available `options` of a `dcc.Dropdown` component!\n","\n","Let's take a look at another example where a `dcc.Slider` updates a `dcc.Graph`."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"aLkXDfgrwr_1"},"source":["### Dash App Layout With Figure and Slider\n","\n","```py\n","import dash\n","import dash_core_components as dcc\n","import dash_html_components as html\n","from dash.dependencies import Input, Output\n","import plotly.express as px\n","\n","import pandas as pd\n","\n","df = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/gapminderDataFiveYear.csv')\n","\n","external_stylesheets = ['https://codepen.io/chriddyp/pen/bWLwgP.css']\n","\n","app = dash.Dash(__name__, external_stylesheets=external_stylesheets)\n","\n","app.layout = html.Div([\n","    dcc.Graph(id='graph-with-slider'),\n","    dcc.Slider(\n","        id='year-slider',\n","        min=df['year'].min(),\n","        max=df['year'].max(),\n","        value=df['year'].min(),\n","        marks={str(year): str(year) for year in df['year'].unique()},\n","        step=None\n","    )\n","])\n","\n","\n","@app.callback(\n","    Output('graph-with-slider', 'figure'),\n","    Input('year-slider', 'value'))\n","def update_figure(selected_year):\n","    filtered_df = df[df.year == selected_year]\n","\n","    fig = px.scatter(filtered_df, x=\"gdpPercap\", y=\"lifeExp\",\n","                     size=\"pop\", color=\"continent\", hover_name=\"country\",\n","                     log_x=True, size_max=55)\n","\n","    fig.update_layout(transition_duration=500)\n","\n","    return fig\n","\n","\n","if __name__ == '__main__':\n","    app.run_server(debug=True)\n","```"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"q83BGSkPw0hN"},"source":["In this example, the `\"value\"` property of the `Slider` is the input of the app and the output of the app is the `\"figure\"` property of the `Graph`. Whenever the `value` of the `Slider` changes, Dash calls the callback function `update_figure` with the new value. The function filters the dataframe with this new value, constructs a `figure` object, and returns it to the Dash application.\n","\n","There are a few nice patterns in this example:\n","\n","1. We're using the Pandas library for importing and filtering datasets in memory.\n","2. We load our dataframe at the start of the app: `df = pd.read_csv('...')`. This dataframe `df` is in the global state of the app and can be read inside the callback functions.\n","3. Loading data into memory can be expensive. By loading querying data at the start of the app instead of inside the callback functions, we ensure that this operation is only done when the app server starts. When a user visits the app or interacts with the app, that data (the `df`) is already in memory. If possible, expensive initialization (like downloading or querying data) should be done in the global scope of the app instead of within the callback functions.\n","4. The callback does not modify the original data, it just creates copies of the dataframe by filtering through pandas filters. This is important: your callbacks should never mutate variables outside of their scope. If your callbacks modify global state, then one user's session might affect the next user's session and when the app is deployed on multiple processes or threads, those modifications will not be shared across sessions.\n","5.
