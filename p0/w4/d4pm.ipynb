    "## Deploy Your Dash Application to Heroku\n",
    "\n",
    "You’re done building your application, and you have a beautiful, fully interactive dashboard. Now you’ll learn how to deploy it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dash apps are Flask apps, so both share the same deployment options. In this section, you’ll deploy your app on Heroku.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you get started, make sure you’ve installed the Heroku command-line interface (CLI) and Git. You can verify that both exist in your system by running these commands at a command prompt (Windows) or at a terminal (macOS, Linux):\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "$ git --version\n",
    "git version 2.21.1 (Apple Git-122.3)\n",
    "$ heroku --version\n",
    "heroku/7.42.2 darwin-x64 node-v12.16.2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The output may change a bit depending on your operating system and the version you have installed, but you shouldn’t get an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s get to it!\n",
    "\n",
    "First, there’s a small change you need to make in `app.py`. After you initialize the app on line 18, add a new variable called server:\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "app = dash.Dash(__name__, external_stylesheets=external_stylesheets)\n",
    "server = app.server\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This addition is necessary to run your app using a WSGI server. It’s not advisable to use Flask’s built-in server in production since it won’t able to handle much traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, in the project’s root directory, create a file called `runtime.txt` where you’ll specify a Python version for your Heroku app:\n",
    "\n",
    "```txt\n",
    "python-3.8.6\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you deploy your app, Heroku will automatically detect that it’s a Python application and will use the correct buildpack. If you also provide a runtime.txt, then it’ll pin down the Python version that your app will use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, create a `requirements.txt` file in the project’s root directory where you’ll copy the libraries required to set up your Dash application on a web server:\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "dash==1.13.3\n",
    "pandas==1.0.5\n",
    "gunicorn==20.0.4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have noticed that there’s a package in requirements.txt you haven’t seen until now: gunicorn. Gunicorn is a WSGI HTTP server that is frequently used for deploying Flask apps to production. You’ll use it to deploy your dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now create a file named `Procfile` with the following content:\n",
    "\n",
    "`web: gunicorn app:server`\n",
    "\n",
    "This file tells the Heroku app what commands should be executed to start your app. In this case, it starts a gunicorn server for your dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you’ll need to initialize a Git repository. To do that, go to your project’s root directory and execute the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "`$ git init`\n",
    "\n",
    "This will start a Git repository in h8_dash/. It’ll start tracking all the changes you make to the files in that directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are files you don’t want to track using Git. For example, you usually want to remove Python compiled files, the contents of your virtual environment folder, or metadata files such as .DS_Store.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid tracking unnecessary files, create a file called `.gitignore` in the root directory. Then copy the following content in it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "venv\n",
    "*.pyc\n",
    ".DS_Store # Only if you are using macOS\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will make sure your repository doesn’t track unnecessary files. Now commit your project files:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "$ git add .\n",
    "$ git commit -m 'Add dashboard files'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Before the final step, make sure you have everything in place. Your project’s structure should look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```dir\n",
    "h8_dash/\n",
    "│\n",
    "├── assets/\n",
    "│   ├── favicon.ico\n",
    "│   └── style.css\n",
    "│\n",
    "├── venv/\n",
    "│\n",
    "├── app.py\n",
    "├── avocado.csv\n",
    "├── Procfile\n",
    "├── requirements.txt\n",
    "└── runtime.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you need to create an app in Heroku, push your code there using Git, and start the app in one of Heroku’s free server options. You can do that by running the following commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "$ heroku create APP-NAME # Choose a name for your app\n",
    "$ git push heroku master\n",
    "$ heroku ps:scale web=1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first command will create a new application on Heroku and an associated Git repository. The second will push the changes to that repository, and the third will start your app in one of Heroku’s free server options.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s it! You’ve built and deployed your dashboard. Now you just need to access it to share it with your friends. To access your app, copy https://APP-NAME.herokuapp.com/ in your browser and replace APP-NAME with the name you defined in the previous step."
