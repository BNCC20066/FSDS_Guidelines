To create those, follow the instructions below, choosing the version that matches your operating system.\n","\n","If you’re using Windows, then open a command prompt and execute these commands:\n","\n","```sh\n","c:\\> mkdir h8_dash && cd h8_dash\n","c:\\> c:\\path\\to\\python\\launcher\\python -m venv venv\n","c:\\> venv\\Scripts\\activate.bat\n","```\n","\n","The first command creates a directory for your project and moves your current location there. The second command creates a virtual environment in that location. The last command activates the virtual environment. Make sure to replace the path in the second command with the path of your Python 3 launcher.\n","\n","If you’re using macOS or Linux, then follow these steps from a terminal:\n","\n","```sh\n","$ mkdir h8_dash && cd h8_dash\n","$ python3 -m venv venv\n","$ source venv/bin/activate\n","```\n","\n","Next, you need to install the required libraries. You can do that using pip inside your virtual environment. Install the libraries as follows:\n","\n","```sh\n","(venv) $ python -m pip install dash==1.13.3 pandas==1.0.5\n","```\n","\n","Finally, you need some data to feed into your dashboard. You can download the data as well as the code you see throughout this tutorial by clicking the link.\n","\n","Save the data as avocado.csv in the root directory of the project. By now, you should have a virtual environment with the required libraries and the data in the root folder of your project. Your project’s structure should look like this:\n","\n","```dir\n","avocado_analytics/\n","|\n","├── venv/\n","|\n","└── avocado.csv\n","```\n","\n","#### Build Dash\n","\n","For development purposes, it’s useful to think of the process of building a Dash application in two steps:\n","\n","1. Define the looks of your application using the app’s layout.\n","2. Use callbacks to determine which parts of your app are interactive and what they react to.\n","\n","**Initializing Your Dash Application**\n","\n","Create an empty file named app.py in the root directory of your project, then review the code of app.py in this section. To make it easier for you to copy the full code, you’ll find the entire contents of app.py at the end of this section.\n","\n","Here are the first few lines of app.py:\n","\n","```py\n","import dash\n","import dash_core_components as dcc\n","import dash_html_components as html\n","import pandas as pd\n","\n","data = pd.read_csv(\"avocado.csv\")\n","data = data.query(\"type == 'conventional' and region == 'Albany'\")\n","data[\"Date\"] = pd.to_datetime(data[\"Date\"], format=\"%Y-%m-%d\")\n","data.sort_values(\"Date\", inplace=True)\n","\n","app = dash.Dash(__name__)\n","```\n","\n","On lines 1 to 4, you import the required libraries: dash, dash_core_components, dash_html_components, and pandas. Each library provides a building block for your application:\n","\n","1. dash helps you initialize your application.\n","2. dash_core_components allows you to create interactive components like graphs, dropdowns, or date ranges.\n","3. dash_html_components lets you access HTML tags.\n","4. pandas helps you read and organize the data.\n","\n","On lines 6 to 9, you read the data and preprocess it for use in the dashboard. You filter some of the data because the current version of your dashboard isn’t interactive, and the plotted values wouldn’t make sense otherwise.\n","\n","On line 11, you create an instance of the Dash class. If you’ve used Flask before, then initializing a Dash class may look familiar. In Flask, you usually initialize a WSGI application using Flask(__name__). Similarly, for a Dash app, you use Dash(__name__).\n","\n","\n","**Defining the Layout of Your Dash Application**\n","\n","Next, you’ll define the layout property of your application. This property dictates the look of your app. In this case, you’ll use a heading with a description below it and two graphs. Here’s how you define it:\n","\n","```py\n","app.layout = html.Div(\n","    children=[\n","        html.H1(children=\"Alpukat Analytics\",),\n","        html.P(\n","            children=\"Analyze the behavior of Alpukat prices\"\n","            \" and the number of Alpukat sold in the US\"\n","            \" between 2015 and 2018\",\n","        ),\n","        dcc.Graph(\n","            figure={\n","                \"data\": [\n","                    {\n","                        \"x\": data[\"Date\"],\n","                        \"y\": data[\"AveragePrice\"],\n","                        \"type\": \"lines\",\n","                    },\n","                ],\n","                \"layout\": {\"title\": \"Average Price of Alpukat\"},\n","            },\n","        ),\n","        dcc.Graph(\n","            figure={\n","                \"data\": [\n","                    {\n","                        \"x\": data[\"Date\"],\n","                        \"y\": data[\"Total Volume\"],\n","                        \"type\": \"lines\",\n","                    },\n","                ],\n","                \"layout\": {\"title\": \"Alpukat Sold\"},\n","            },\n","        ),\n","    ]\n",")\n","```\n","\n","This code defines the layout property of the app object. This property determines the looks of your application using a tree structure made of Dash components.\n","\n","Dash components come prepackaged in Python libraries. Some of them come with Dash when you install it. The rest you have to install separately. You’ll see two sets of components in almost every app:\n","\n","1. Dash HTML Components provides you with Python wrappers for HTML elements. For example, you could use this library to create elements such as paragraphs, headings, or lists.\n","2. Dash Core Components provides you with Python abstractions for creating interactive user interfaces. You can use it to create interactive elements such as graphs, sliders, or dropdowns.\n","\n","On lines 13 to 20, you can see the Dash HTML components in practice. You start by defining the parent component, an html.Div. Then you add two more elements, a heading (html.H1) and a paragraph (html.P), as its children.\n","\n","These components are equivalent to the div, h1, and p HTML tags. You can use the components’ arguments to modify attributes or the content of the tags. For example, to specify what goes inside the div tag, you use the children argument in html.Div.\n","\n","There are also other arguments in the components, such as style, className, or id, that refer to attributes of the HTML tags. You’ll see how to use some of these properties to style your dashboard in the next section.\n","\n","The part of the layout shown on lines 13 to 20 will get transformed into the following HTML code:\n","\n","```html\n","<div>\n","  <h1>Alpukat Analytics</h1>\n","  <p>\n","    Analyze the behavior of Alpukat prices and the number\n","    of Alpukat sold in the US between 2015 and 2018\n","  </p>\n","  <!-- Rest of the app -->\n","</div>\n","```\n","\n","This HTML code is rendered when you open your application in the browser. It follows the same structure as your Python code, with a div tag containing an h1 and a p element.\n","\n","On lines 21 to 24 in the layout code snippet, you can see the graph component from Dash Core Components in practice. There are two dcc.Graph components in the app.layout. The first one plots the average prices of avocados during the period of study, and the second plots the number of avocados sold in the United States during the same period.\n","\n","Under the hood, Dash uses Plotly.js to generate graphs. The dcc.Graph components expect a figure object or a Python dictionary containing the plot’s data and layout. In this case, you provide the latter.\n","\n","Finally, these two lines of code help you run your application:\n","\n","```py\n","if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n","    app.run_server(debug=True)\n","```\n","\n","Lines 48 and 49 make it possible to run your Dash application locally using Flask’s built-in server. The debug=True parameter from app.run_server enables the hot-reloading option in your application. This means that when you make a change to your app, it reloads automatically, without you having to restart the server.\n","\n","Now it’s time to run your application. Open a terminal inside your project’s root directory and in the project’s virtual environment. Run python app.py, then go to `http://localhost:8050` using your preferred browser."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Td8mujkWp6Sv"},"source":["### Styling your Dash\n","\n","Dash provides you with a lot of flexibility to customize the look of your application. You can use your own CSS or JavaScript files, set a favicon (small icon shown on the web browser), and embed images, among other advanced options.\n","\n","In this section, you’ll learn how to apply custom styles to components, and then you’ll style the dashboard you built in the previous section.\n","\n","**How to Apply a Custom Style to Your Components**\n","\n","You can style components in two ways:\n","\n","1. Using the style argument of individual components\n","2. Providing an external CSS file\n","\n","Using the style argument to customize your dashboard is straightforward. This argument takes a Python dictionary with key-value pairs consisting of the names of CSS properties and the values you want to set.\n","\n","If you wanted to adjust the font size and text color of the H1 element in app.py, then you could use the className argument as follows:\n","\n","```py\n","html.H1(\n","    children=\"Alpukat Analytics\",\n","    className=\"header-title\",\n","),\n","```\n","\n","Setting the className argument will define the class attribute for the H1 element. You could then use a CSS file in the assets folder to specify how you want it to look:\n","\n","```css\n",".header-title {\n","  font-size: 48px;\n","  color: red;\n","}\n","```\n","\n","You use a class selector to format the heading in your CSS file. This selector will adjust the heading format. You could also use it with other element that needs to share the format by setting className=\"header-title\".\n","\n","\n","**Adding External Assets to Your Application**\n","\n","\n","Create a folder called assets/ in your project’s root directory. Download a [favicon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ardhiraka/H8_Prakerja2021/master/assets/favicon.ico) from the Twemoji open source project and save it as favicon.ico in assets/. Finally, create a CSS file in assets/ called style.css and the code in the collapsible section below.\n","\n","```css\n","body {\n","    font-family: \"Lato\", sans-serif;\n","    margin: 0;\n","    background-color: #F7F7F7;\n","}\n","\n",".header {\n","    background-color: #CA4115;\n","    height: 256px;\n","    display: flex;\n","    flex-direction: column;\n","    justify-content: center;\n","}\n","\n",".header-emoji {\n","    font-size: 48px;\n","    margin: 0 auto;\n","    text-align: center;\n","}\n","\n",".header-title {\n","    color: #FFFFFF;\n","    font-size: 48px;\n","    font-weight: bold;\n","    text-align: center;\n","    margin: 0 auto;\n","}\n","\n",".header-description {\n","    color: #CFCFCF;\n","    margin: 4px auto;\n","    text-align: center;\n","    max-width: 384px;\n","}\n","\n",".wrapper {\n","    margin-right: auto;\n","    margin-left: auto;\n","    max-width: 1024px;\n","    padding-right: 10px;\n","    padding-left: 10px;\n","    margin-top: 32px;\n","}\n","\n",".card {\n","    margin-bottom: 24px;\n","    box-shadow: 0 4px 6px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.18);\n","}\n","\n","```\n","\n","The assets/ file contains the styles you’ll apply to components in your application’s layout.

You include two files in `assets/: favicon.ico` and `style.css`. For setting a default favicon, you don’t have to take any additional steps. For using the styles you defined in style.css, you’ll need to use the className argument in Dash components.\n","\n","app.py requires a few changes. You’ll include an external style sheet, add a title to your dashboard, and style the components using the style.css file. Review the changes below. Then, in the last part of this section, you’ll find the full code for your updated version of app.py.\n","\n","Here’s how you include an external style sheet and add a title to your dashboard:\n","\n","```py\n","external_stylesheets = [\n","    {\n","        \"href\": \"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?\"\n","                \"family=Lato:wght@400;700&display=swap\",\n","        \"rel\": \"stylesheet\",\n","    },\n","]\n","app = dash.Dash(__name__, external_stylesheets=external_stylesheets)\n","app.title = \"Avocado Analytics: Understand Your Avocados!\"\n","```\n","\n","On lines 11 to 18, you specify an external CSS file, a font family, that you want to load in your application. External files are added to the head tag of your application and loaded before the body of your application loads. You use the external_stylesheets argument for adding external CSS files or external_scripts for external JavaScript files like Google Analytics.\n","\n","On line 19, you set the title of your application. This is the text that appears in the title bar of your web browser, in Google’s search results, and in social media cards when you share your site.\n","\n","**Customizing the Styles of Components**\n","\n","To use the styles in style.css, you’ll need to use the className argument in Dash components.

It’ll include two dropdowns and a date range selector that the user can use to filter the data and update the graphs.\n","\n","Here’s how that looks in app.py:\n","\n","```py\n","html.Div(\n","    children=[\n","        html.Div(\n","            children=[\n","                html.Div(children=\"Region\", className=\"menu-title\"),\n","                dcc.Dropdown(\n","                    id=\"region-filter\",\n","                    options=[\n","                        {\"label\": region, \"value\": region}\n","                        for region in np.sort(data.region.unique())\n","                    ],\n","                    value=\"Albany\",\n","                    clearable=False,\n","                    className=\"dropdown\",\n","                ),\n","            ]\n","        ),\n","        html.Div(\n","            children=[\n","                html.Div(children=\"Type\", className=\"menu-title\"),\n","                dcc.Dropdown(\n","                    id=\"type-filter\",\n","                    options=[\n","                        {\"label\": Alpukat_type, \"value\": Alpukat_type}\n","                        for Alpukat_type in data.type.unique()\n","                    ],\n","                    value=\"organic\",\n","                    clearable=False,\n","                    searchable=False,\n","                    className=\"dropdown\",\n","                ),\n","            ],\n","        ),\n","        html.Div(\n","            children=[\n","                html.Div(\n","                    children=\"Date Range\",\n","                    className=\"menu-title\"\n","                    ),\n","                dcc.DatePickerRange(\n","                    id=\"date-range\",\n","                    min_date_allowed=data.Date.min().date(),\n","                    max_date_allowed=data.Date.max().date(),\n","                    start_date=data.Date.min().date(),\n","                    end_date=data.Date.max().date(),\n","                ),\n","            ]\n","        ),\n","    ],\n","    className=\"menu\",\n","),\n","```\n","\n","On lines 24 to 74, you define an html.Div on top of your graphs consisting of two dropdowns and a date range selector. It will serve as a menu that the user will use to interact with the data.\n","\n","The first component in the menu is the Region dropdown. Here’s the code for that component:\n","\n","```py\n","html.Div(\n","    children=[\n","        html.Div(children=\"Region\", className=\"menu-title\"),\n","        dcc.Dropdown(\n","            id=\"region-filter\",\n","            options=[\n","                {\"label\": region, \"value\": region}\n","                for region in np.sort(data.region.unique())\n","            ],\n","            value=\"Albany\",\n","            clearable=False,\n","            className=\"dropdown\",\n","        ),\n","    ]\n","),\n","```\n","\n","On lines 41 to 55, you define the dropdown that users will use to filter the data by region. In addition to the title, it has a dcc.Dropdown component. Here’s what each of the parameters means:\n","\n","- id is the identifier of this element.\n","- options is the options shown when the dropdown is selected. It expects a dictionary with labels and values.\n","- value is the default value when the page loads.\n","- clearable allows the user to leave this field empty if set to True.\n","- className is a class selector used for applying styles.\n","\n","The Type and Date Range selectors follow the same structure as the Region dropdown. Feel free to review them on your own.\n","\n","Next, take a look at the dcc.Graphs components:\n","\n","```py\n","html.Div(\n","    children=[\n","        html.Div(\n","            children=dcc.Graph(\n","                id=\"price-chart\", config={\"displayModeBar\": False},\n","            ),\n","            className=\"card\",\n","        ),\n","        html.Div(\n","            children=dcc.Graph(\n","                id=\"volume-chart\", config={\"displayModeBar\": False},\n","            ),\n","            className=\"card\",\n","        ),\n","    ],\n","    className=\"wrapper\",\n","),\n","```\n","\n","On lines 90 to 106, you define the dcc.Graph components. You may have noticed that, compared to the previous version of the dashboard, the components are missing the figure argument. That’s because the figure argument will now be generated by a callback function using the inputs the user sets using the Region, Type, and Date Range selectors.\n","\n","**How to Define Callbacks**\n","\n","You’ve defined how the user will interact with your application. Now you need to make your application react to user interactions. For that, you’ll use callback functions.\n","\n","Dash’s callback functions are regular Python functions with an app.callback decorator. In Dash, when an input changes, a callback function is triggered. The function performs some predetermined operations, like filtering a dataset, and returns an output to the application. In essence, callbacks link inputs and outputs in your app.\n","\n","Here’s the callback function used for updating the graphs:\n","\n","```py\n","@app.callback(\n","    [Output(\"price-chart\", \"figure\"), Output(\"volume-chart\", \"figure\")],\n","    [\n","        Input(\"region-filter\", \"value\"),\n","        Input(\"type-filter\", \"value\"),\n","        Input(\"date-range\", \"start_date\"),\n","        Input(\"date-range\", \"end_date\"),\n","    ],\n",")\n","def update_charts(region, Alpukat_type, start_date, end_date):\n","    mask = (\n","        (data.region == region)\n","        & (data.type == Alpukat_type)\n","        & (data.Date >= start_date)\n","        & (data.Date <= end_date)\n","    )\n","    filtered_data = data.loc[mask, :]\n","    price_chart_figure = {\n","        \"data\": [\n","            {\n","                \"x\": filtered_data[\"Date\"],\n","                \"y\": filtered_data[\"AveragePrice\"],\n","                \"type\": \"lines\",\n","                \"hovertemplate\": \"$%{y:.2f}<extra></extra>\",\n","            },\n","        ],\n","        \"layout\": {\n","            \"title\": {\n","                \"text\": \"Average Price of Alpukats\",\n","                \"x\": 0.05,\n","                \"xanchor\": \"left\",\n","            },\n","            \"xaxis\": {\"fixedrange\": True},\n","            \"yaxis\": {\"tickprefix\": \"$\", \"fixedrange\": True},\n","            \"colorway\": [\"#17B897\"],\n","        },\n","    }\n","\n","    volume_chart_figure = {\n","        \"data\": [\n","            {\n","                \"x\": filtered_data[\"Date\"],\n","                \"y\": filtered_data[\"Total Volume\"],\n","                \"type\": \"lines\",\n","            },\n","        ],\n","        \"layout\": {\n","            \"title\": {\"text\": \"Alpukats Sold\", \"x\": 0.05, \"xanchor\": \"left\"},\n","            \"xaxis\": {\"fixedrange\": True},\n","            \"yaxis\": {\"fixedrange\": True},\n","            \"colorway\": [\"#E12D39\"],\n","        },\n","    }\n","    return price_chart_figure, volume_chart_figure\n","```\n","\n","On lines 111 to 119, you define the inputs and outputs inside the app.callback decorator.\n","\n","First, you define the outputs using Output objects. These objects take two arguments:\n","\n","1. The identifier of the element that they’ll modify when the function executes\n","2. The property of the element to be modified\n","\n","For example, Output(\"price-chart\", \"figure\") will update the figure property of the \"price-chart\" element.\n","\n","Then you define the inputs using Input objects. They also take two arguments:\n","\n","1. The identifier of the element they’ll be watching for changes\n","2. The property of the watched element that they should take when a change happens\n","\n","So, Input(\"region-filter\", \"value\") will watch the \"region-filter\" element for changes and will take its value property if the element changes.\n","\n","On line 120, you define the function that will be applied when an input changes. One thing to notice here is that the arguments of the function will correspond with the order of the Input objects supplied to the callback. There’s no explicit relationship between the names of the arguments in the function and the values specified in the Input objects.\n","\n","Finally, on lines 121 to 164, you define the body of the function. In this case, the function takes the inputs (region, type of avocado, and date range), filters the data, and generates the figure objects for the price and volume charts."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"l1Yg4_lzmMMj"},"source":["## Deploy Your Dash Application to Heroku\n","\n","You’re done building your application, and you have a beautiful, fully interactive dashboard. Now you’ll learn how to deploy it.\n","\n","Dash apps are Flask apps, so both share the same deployment options. In this section, you’ll deploy your app on Heroku.\n","\n","Before you get started, make sure you’ve installed the Heroku command-line interface (CLI) and Git. You can verify that both exist in your system by running these commands at a command prompt (Windows) or at a terminal (macOS, Linux):\n","\n","```sh\n","$ git --version\n","git version 2.21.1 (Apple Git-122.3)\n","$ heroku --version\n","heroku/7.42.2 darwin-x64 node-v12.16.2\n","```\n","\n","The output may change a bit depending on your operating system and the version you have installed, but you shouldn’t get an error.\n","\n","Let’s get to it!\n","\n","First, there’s a small change you need to make in `app.py`. After you initialize the app on line 18, add a new variable called server:\n","\n","```py\n","app = dash.Dash(__name__, external_stylesheets=external_stylesheets)\n","server = app.server\n","```\n","\n","This addition is necessary to run your app using a WSGI server. It’s not advisable to use Flask’s built-in server in production since it won’t able to handle much traffic.\n","\n","Next, in the project’s root directory, create a file called `runtime.txt` where you’ll specify a Python version for your Heroku app:\n","\n","```txt\n","python-3.8.6\n","```\n","\n","When you deploy your app, Heroku will automatically detect that it’s a Python application and will use the correct buildpack. If you also provide a runtime.txt, then it’ll pin down the Python version that your app will use.\n","\n","Next, create a `requirements.txt` file in the project’s root directory where you’ll copy the libraries required to set up your Dash application on a web server:\n","\n","```py\n","dash==1.13.3\n","pandas==1.0.5\n","gunicorn==20.0.4\n","```\n","\n","You may have noticed that there’s a package in requirements.txt you haven’t seen until now: gunicorn. Gunicorn is a WSGI HTTP server that is frequently used for deploying Flask apps to production. You’ll use it to deploy your dashboard.\n","\n","Now create a file named `Procfile` with the following content:\n","\n","`web: gunicorn app:server`\n","\n","This file tells the Heroku app what commands should be executed to start your app. In this case, it starts a gunicorn server for your dashboard.\n","\n","Next, you’ll need to initialize a Git repository. To do that, go to your project’s root directory and execute the following command:\n","\n","`$ git init`\n","\n","This will start a Git repository in h8_dash/. It’ll start tracking all the changes you make to the files in that directory.\n","\n","However, there are files you don’t want to track using Git. For example, you usually want to remove Python compiled files, the contents of your virtual environment folder, or metadata files such as .DS_Store.\n","\n","To avoid tracking unnecessary files, create a file called `.gitignore` in the root directory. Then copy the following content in it:\n","\n","```py\n","venv\n","*.pyc\n",".DS_Store # Only if you are using macOS\n","```\n","\n","This will make sure your repository doesn’t track unnecessary files. Now commit your project files:\n","\n","```sh\n","$ git add .\n","$ git commit -m 'Add dashboard files'\n","```\n","\n","Before the final step, make sure you have everything in place. Your project’s structure should look like this:\n","\n","```dir\n","h8_dash/\n","│\n","├── assets/\n","│   ├── favicon.ico\n","│   └── style.css\n","│\n","├── venv/\n","│\n","├── app.py\n","├── avocado.csv\n","├── Procfile\n","├── requirements.txt\n","└── runtime.txt\n","```\n","\n","Finally, you need to create an app in Heroku, push your code there using Git, and start the app in one of Heroku’s free server options. You can do that by running the following commands:\n","\n","```sh\n","$ heroku create APP-NAME # Choose a name for your app\n","$ git push heroku master\n","$ heroku ps:scale web=1\n","```\n","\n","The first command will create a new application on Heroku and an associated Git repository. The second will push the changes to that repository, and the third will start your app in one of Heroku’s free server options.\n","\n","That’s it! You’ve built and deployed your dashboard.

It’s not advisable to use Flask’s built-in server in production since it won’t able to handle much traffic.\n","\n","Next, in the project’s root directory, create a file called `runtime.txt` where you’ll specify a Python version for your Heroku app:\n","\n","```txt\n","python-3.8.6\n","```\n","\n","When you deploy your app, Heroku will automatically detect that it’s a Python application and will use the correct buildpack. If you also provide a runtime.txt, then it’ll pin down the Python version that your app will use.\n","\n","Next, create a `requirements.txt` file in the project’s root directory where you’ll copy the libraries required to set up your Dash application on a web server:\n","\n","```py\n","dash\n","dash_bootstrap_components\n","pandas\n","gunicorn\n","```\n","\n","You may have noticed that there’s a package in requirements.txt you haven’t seen until now: gunicorn. Gunicorn is a WSGI HTTP server that is frequently used for deploying Flask apps to production. You’ll use it to deploy your dashboard.\n","\n","Now create a file named `Procfile` with the following content:\n","\n","`web: gunicorn index:server`\n","\n","This file tells the Heroku index what commands should be executed to start your app. In this case, it starts a gunicorn server for your dashboard.\n","\n","Next, you’ll need to initialize a Git repository. To do that, go to your project’s root directory and execute the following command:\n","\n","`$ git init`\n","\n","This will start a Git repository in h8_dash/. It’ll start tracking all the changes you make to the files in that directory.\n","\n","However, there are files you don’t want to track using Git. For example, you usually want to remove Python compiled files, the contents of your virtual environment folder, or metadata files such as .DS_Store.\n","\n","To avoid tracking unnecessary files, create a file called `.gitignore` in the root directory. Then copy the following content in it:\n","\n","```py\n","venv\n","*.pyc\n",".DS_Store # Only if you are using macOS\n","```\n","\n","This will make sure your repository doesn’t track unnecessary files. Now commit your project files:\n","\n","```sh\n","$ git add .\n","$ git commit -m 'Add dashboard files'\n","```\n","\n","Finally, you need to create an app in Heroku, push your code there using Git, and start the app in one of Heroku’s free server options. You can do that by running the following commands:\n","\n","```sh\n","$ heroku create APP-NAME # Choose a name for your app\n","$ git push heroku master\n","$ heroku ps:scale web=1\n","```\n","\n","The first command will create a new application on Heroku and an associated Git repository. The second will push the changes to that repository, and the third will start your app in one of Heroku’s free server options.\n","\n","That’s it! You’ve built and deployed your dashboard. Now you just need to access it to share it with your friends. To access your app, copy https://APP-NAME.herokuapp.com/ in your browser and replace APP-NAME with the name you defined in the previous step."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"2qG_NtXCkqaT"},"source":[""],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
