Individual modules can then be cobbled together like building blocks to create a larger application.\n","\n","There are several advantages to modularizing code in a large application:\n","\n","- **Simplicity**: Rather than focusing on the entire problem at hand, a module typically focuses on **one relatively small portion of the problem**. If you’re working on a single module, you’ll have a smaller problem domain to wrap your head around. This makes development easier and less error-prone.\n","\n","- **Maintainability**: Modules are typically designed so that they enforce logical boundaries between different problem domains. If modules are written in a way that minimizes interdependency, there is decreased likelihood that modifications to a single module will have an impact on other parts of the program. **(You may even be able to make changes to a module without having any knowledge of the application outside that module.)** This makes it more viable for a team of many programmers to work collaboratively on a large application.\n","\n","- **Reusability**: Functionality defined in a single module can be easily reused (through an appropriately defined interface) by other parts of the application. **This eliminates the need to recreate duplicate code.**\n","\n","- **Scoping**: Modules typically define a separate namespace, which helps **avoid collisions** between identifiers in different areas of a program."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"XAJklZOkuujb"},"source":["## Python Modules: Overview\n","There are actually three different ways to define a module in Python:\n","\n","- A module can be written in Python itself such as `Scrapy`,  `Scikit-Learn`.\n","- A module can be written in C and loaded dynamically at run-time, like the `re` (regular expression) module.\n","- A built-in module is intrinsically contained in the interpreter, like the `time`, `os`, `sys` modules.\n","\n","A module’s contents are accessed the same way in all three cases: with the `import` statement.\n","\n","Here, the focus will mostly be on modules that are written in Python.
