It is also quite heavy so hang on! We will start with getting some ideas on eigenvectors and eigenvalues. We will develop on the idea that a matrix can be seen as a linear transformation and that applying a matrix on its eigenvectors gives new vectors with the same direction. Then we will see how to express quadratic equations into the matrix form. We will see that the eigendecomposition of the matrix corresponding to a quadratic equation can be used to find the minimum and maximum of this function. As a bonus, we will also see how to visualize linear transformations in Python!"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"8krirvaKgl5j"},"source":["## Eigendecomposition"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"BQbpkBfKgl5k"},"source":["The eigendecomposition is one form of matrix decomposition. Decomposing a matrix means that we want to find a product of matrices that is equal to the initial matrix. In the case of the eigendecomposition, we decompose the initial matrix into the product of its eigenvectors and eigenvalues. Before all, let's see what are eigenvectors and eigenvalues.\n","\n","### Matrices as linear transformations\n","\n","As we have seen in [2.3](https://hadrienj.github.io/posts/Deep-Learning-Book-Series-2.3-Identity-and-Inverse-Matrices/) with the example of the identity matrix, you can think of matrices as linear transformations. Some matrices will rotate your space, others will rescale it etc. So when we apply a matrix to a vector, we end up with a transformed version of the vector. When we say that we 'apply' the matrix to the vector it means that we calculate the dot product of the matrix with the vector. We will start with a basic example of this kind of transformation.\n","\n","### Example
