Finally! Welcome to Phase 2
=======================

Hello all **Hacktiv8's Pythoneer**! Finally, welcome to Phase 2. Prepare yourself for your last journey ahead.

In Phase 2 you are going to learn all about Neural Network in order to fullfil phase 2's objectives, which is:

- Able to build own artificial neural network
- Having knowledge in computer vision and its implementation
- Having knowledge in natural language processing and its implementation
- Having knowledge of big data

In the first week, you are going to learn about Artificial Neural Networks. Outcome of this week of lecture are having a good knowledge about ANN, able to train deep neural networks, and able to build your own models using TensorFlow.

Second week, you are going to go deep into Neural Network Class such as Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Network. Learn about the architecture, Computer Vision, and Natural Language Processing.

After going deep with Neural Network, in third week you are going to learn more about Neural Network such as GAN and Deployment, and Big Data. Learn about Deploying TensorFlow model at scale, Spark, Hadoop, Hive, and Pig.

You also going to learn principal of data ethics as a data scientist such as Ownership, Transaction Transparency, Concent, etc.

Last week in Phase 2 you are going to prepare yourself for your Final Projects. This week is fully used for career preparation, mentoring, and thunder talk for your final projects.
