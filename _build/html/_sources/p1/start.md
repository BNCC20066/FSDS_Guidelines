Congratulations! Welcome to Phase 1
=======================

Hello all **Hacktiv8's Pythoneer**! Congratulations and welcome to Phase 1. Prepare yourself for your journey ahead.

In Phase 1 you are going to learn all about Machine Learning in order to fullfil phase 1's objectives, which is:

- Able to complete end-to-end machine learning projects

In the first week, you are going to learn Machine Learning Landscape, Regression, and Classification algorithm such as Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine. Outcome of this week of lecture are having basic knowledge about machine learning concept specially regression and classification.

You also be able to build and train your first machine learning model used for regression using Linear Regression or classification using Logistic Regression or Support Vector Machine.

Second week, you are continuing your journey in machine learning. Learn about more classification algorithm such as Ensemble Learning, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Naive Bayes.

After going deep with Supervised Learning, in third week you are going to learn about Unsupervised Learning. Learn about Dimensionality Reduction using PCA, Clustering, Anomaly Detection, and more.

Last week in Phase 1 you are going to learn optimization. Start with Model Evaluation and Improvement with Cross-Validation and Grid Search, and building pipelines.
You also going to learn how to work with text data, grasp the concept of tf-idf and basic text processing.

```{attention}
Phase 1 have **3** Non-Graded Challenges, **5** Graded Challenges, **3** Live Codes, and **2 Milestones**.
